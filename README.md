## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [-] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] A tooltip system for the options in the form of a '?'
- [x] A Neverending gamemode
- [x] Various selectable difficulties
- [x] Incremental sounds for the nodes according to color (white = highest pitch, grey = lowest pitch)
- [x] Last Straw setting that allows the User to play with only one life
- [x] A score system that keeps track of the highest score in real time- with multipliers according to settings
- [x] OOP based implementation
- [x] Dynamic Board loading
- [x] Fixed a cheating bug where the user could click during playback

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [The Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/) & [Javascript documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference).

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   Most of the features were painless to implement, but what stood out to me as a challenge was
   debugging the Sound Synthesizer. I never have utilized the _AudioContext_ oject in Javascript
   before, or done much sound work in the browser at all to be completely honest, so I ran into
   some very niche issues. For example, I had a hard time attempting to make the sound of the notes
   align with the clicking of the node (versus coming after). Initially, I just removed the padding
   added to the context. And that worked, until it didnt. After a little while it would fall off
   beat again. I started doing some debugging in the form of documentation reading, and following
   the call stack line by line. The issue ended up being that _AudioContext_ objects can actually
   become out of sync over time and load. This is actually something out of the realm of my abilitiy
   to fix reliably, so I just added some timing mechanisims to potentially ease the issue.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   Playing around with the audio synthesizer was a lot of fun, it was something I hadn't touched
   on before. I'm very curious about the implemntations that other services utilize for their sound
   systems. I've spent a lot of time practicing deabstractation, and I would love to practice that in regards
   to the foundational blocks of web development. Especially when theres a lot of bloaded development in Javascript.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   I would redesgin this from the ground up, and craft a more modernized front-end. I would also most deffinitely
   do this in react/typescript as well, as that speeds up development and testing significantly. A level system
   could also be a really cool implementation, with a leaderboards and such.
